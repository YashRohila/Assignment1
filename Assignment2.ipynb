        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important\n",
        "- Data structures in Python are tools for organising and managing data effeciently. Python has inbuilt data structures such as:\n",
        "-List, Dictonaries, Tuples and sets\n",
        "- They are important because of smooth data handling, improved algorithms , problem solving and algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "- Mutable data types are the ones which can be changed after declaration. It changes the orginal object without creating new one\n",
        "- Example of mutable:\n",
        "numbers=[1,2,3] numbers.append(4) print(numbers) Output: [1,2,3,4]\n",
        "- Immutable are the data types which can not be changed after creation.\n",
        "- Example of imutable: coordinates(1,2) coordinates[0]=3 #This will show an error because tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
        "- The main difference between list and tuple is that list are mutable and tuples are immutable.\n",
        "- There is syntax difference too for list we use [] brackets and for tuples we use () brackets\n",
        "- The performance of list are slow because they can be changed and tuples are faster than list because of its immutable behaviour\n",
        "- List support methods like append(), remove whereas tuple support count(),index()\n",
        "- List are unhashable and tuples are hashable\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dictonaries save data in form of key and value pair\n",
        "- Example: my_dict={\"name\":\"yash\",\"age\":25}\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "- For unique elements\n",
        "- For fast memebership testing\n",
        "- For performing set operations like union, intersection and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "- String are immutable and List is mutable\n",
        "- The data type of string is sequence of characters and for list it is sequence of elements such which can be of any type.\n",
        "- Strings are enclosed in '' or \"\" but List are enclosed in []\n",
        "- Strings include method like .upper(),.lower() and .replace() whereas List include methods like .append(),.pop(),.sort()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "- Tuples ensures data integrirty by being immutable, hashable which resist to accidental or intentional modification\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "- Hashtable is a data structure which stores the data in term of key value pairs. It uses hash function to compute and index for a given key which shows that the key value pair is store at the index.\n",
        "- Hash table is directly connected to dictionaries because dictionaries are saved in the form of key-value pair\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "- Yes list can contain different data types in Python. It can store mix of int, float ,string, object,list and many more.\n",
        "- Example: li= [42,\"hello\", True, [1,2,3], 1.25]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "- Strings are immutable in Python to ensure: -\n",
        "- Effeciency in memory usage\n",
        "- Safety by preventing unintended modifications\n",
        "- Reliability in data structures\n",
        "- Optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "- Dictionary doesnt have duplicates which ensures data integrity\n",
        "- Dictionaries have unique key value association\n",
        "- For faster lookups\n",
        "- When we dont need data to be in order but needed to accessed by unique key identifier\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "- We will use tuple over list where we need data to be consistent, immutable and data intended to remain unchanged tuples would be prefer over list because tuples give data integrity, performance benefits and clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "- In python sets automatically handle duplicate values by eliminating them to ensure every element in a set is unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- In list \"in\" keyword checks the presence of value in list whereas in dictionaries \"in\" keyword search for key not values\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "- We can not modify the elements of tuple because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case/\n",
        "- Nested dictionary are te dictionary where values of the key are dictonary itself which is good for storing heirichal data.\n",
        "- students ={ \"student1\": \"name\":\"yash\", \"age\":25, \"grades\": {\"maths\":85,\"science\":95}}\n",
        "\n",
        "17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
        "- The time complexity of accessing elements in dictionary depends on following factorrs:\n",
        "- Average case O(1) , Worst case O(n)\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries\n",
        "- List are preferred over dictionaries when we need :\n",
        "- Order or sequential data\n",
        "- Need index based access\n",
        "- To do iteration over a simple sequence values\n",
        "- where we want to work with simple data rather than key value data\n",
        "- when memory effeciency is a concern\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval\n",
        "- Dictionaries are implemented using hashtable. hashtable uses has function to map key to specific location in memory\n",
        "- Theres is no relatioship between key order and physical relation in menorty\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval\n",
        "- List is an ordered collection of elements whereas dictionary is unorderd collection of key value pairs.\n",
        "- List allows duplicate values but dictionary requires unique keys\n",
