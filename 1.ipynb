        "  1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a programming language. Python is famous because of its versality, ease of use and have lot of different libraries which can be used for data manipulation ,visualization, statical analysis, machine learning. Also Python has active and growing community which works on continous development on availability of resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - Intepreter is a program that reads and execute the code of python line by line .It actually converts the high level code to the machine code which can be understand by computer easily\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "   - Predefined keywords are reserved keyword that has special meaning which can not be used as identifiers such variable and functions names.There are total 35 pre defined keywords in python.\n",
        "   The prefedefined keyword are as follows:-\n",
        "   False, None, True, and, as, assert, async, await, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No keywords can not be used as variavle names because if do that it will show an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "   - Mutability means that we can change the value or content of an object in Python after creation\n",
        "   - Example: list,dictionaries,set\n",
        "   - Code: list1=[1,2,3,4]\n",
        "list1[0]=5\n",
        "print(list1)\n",
        "\n",
        "   6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic collections.They They allow for add, removal and modifying there are made for such situation where data can change during program execution.\n",
        "   - Code:-> list1=[1,2,3,4]\n",
        "     list1[0]=5\n",
        "     print(list1)\n",
        "   - On the other hand tupples are fixed data collections.Once tupples are made it can not changed which gives us several benefits such as performance, hashibiliy and security.\n",
        "What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "   7.\n",
        "   - Equality(==) :-> It checks the values of two objects are equals or not.If there are two different objects and their values are same they are considered to be true.\n",
        "   - x=[1,2,3,4]\n",
        "y=x;\n",
        "z=[1,2,3,4]\n",

        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"false\")\n",
        "   - Identity(is) :-> It refers to the value of variable refer to the same object or not.\n",

        "\n",
        "   8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "   - Logical operator are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. They help in combining multiple conditions and expression to give a boolean resultant value.\n",
        "   - Logical operators are: and, or and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "   9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "   - Type casting in python converts one data type to another data type using in-built functions.\n",
        "   - x=\"123\"\n",
        "y=int(x)\n",
        "print(type(y))\n",
        "\n",
        "   10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit :-> In this one type of conversion is done into another automatically by the Interpreter. There is low risk of error.\n",
        "   - a=2 b=3.5 c=a+b print(c)  //Converted to float\n",
        "   - Explicit :-> This type of conversion is done manually by the programmer by using type conversion. There can be data loss when not done correctly.\n",
        "   - x=\"123\"\n",
        "y=int(x)\n",
        "print(type(y))\n",
        "\n",
        "   11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "   - The main purpose of conditional statements are to make decisions and execut the relevant code which depends on condition wheather its true or false\n",
        "   -a=85\n",
        "if(a>=90):\n",
        "    print(\"grade a\")\n",

        "\n",
        "    12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - It is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence which will be better understand by a code\n",

        "    13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "    - The major difference betweeen both of them is of syntax.\n",
        "    - for loop runs where number of iterations are finite and known and while loop we do not know about the number of iterations.\n",
        "    - for loop iterate over string, list and ranges whereas in while until the task is done it  keeps on running\n",
        "    - for loop:- for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i)\n",

        "    - while loop is more suitable than for loop where we do not know about the number of iterations. We can take example of use login where we are not known that how many time user want to login.\n",
